This repository contains the codes used for light curve analysis conducted for my Capstone project.
The techniques utilized here are based on "Understanding the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram" by VanderPlas (2018).
The data was taken from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey data release 3 at https://crts.iucaa.in/CRTS/.
